##Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a course project for the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Getting and Cleaning Data online course] (https://class.coursera.org/getdata-005/). This repository consists of two essential components: the R script used for analysis (*run_analysis.R*) and the codebook (*CodeBook.md*). The output of the R script, which is the required tidy data, is also included in this repository. The data used for this project can be downloaded [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The **run_analysis** script was used to transform the raw data into what is formally known as *tidy data* in preparation for further analysis. The output of the script is the transformed combination of the training and test data.

Please consult **CodeBook.md** for more information regarding the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.
